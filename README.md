# Discogs Import

This script (`ruby main.rb`) will:
1. Take a list of artist-albums (from say an organized note)
1. Look them up on the [Discogs API](https://www.discogs.com/developers/)
1. Ask you if it found the right album
1. Add the album to your Discogs Wantlist.

In order to get this to work, you'll have to:
- Create a Discogs API Personal Access Token
- Create a few environment variables in `.env ` 
- Tweak how the artist-album array is generated
- Answer a few questions in the command line
- Approve of adding these to Discogs.

My goal was to add all my wanted albums to Discogs so that I can check on [Zion's Gate Records' Discogs merchant page](https://www.discogs.com/seller/zionsgate/profile) to see if I can pick up some records while I'm in Seattle for a few days. 
They only have three on my wantlist (so was it worth three hours of my time ðŸ¥²) but one of them is [Men I Trust â€Žâ€“ Forever Live Sessions](https://www.discogs.com/sell/item/3190905913) so.......
